# Using the Media Creation Tool

One of the most common solutions to many problems in Windows is reinstalling it. While built-in settings exist that do this, they rely on an embedded image that can often become unstable or unusable, and as such the Media Creation Tool is recommended for this purpose.

At least 8 GB of space on the `C:` drive is required to run the tool.

## Downloading the tool

### How to re-install Windows using a USB

1. Turn on the computer that is not working, and repeatedly press the boot menu key. This depends on the manufacturer of your device and can be found out using a web search engine.

2. Once open, move the cursor using the arrow keys to the name of the USB you have inserted and then press Enter.

You will now boot to the Windows Installer. For further guidance, see [Installing Windows](installing-windows).
