       Chill server, members are nice, moderators are great and understanding, just that you should follow the rules. Verbal warns might be issued for first time violations, so you got to be careful with that.

       Been here for 2 years and it feels like I'm home. The members (including the staff) are so hospitable that it makes me feel like that. Will recommend the server to someone else and defo will stay here!
